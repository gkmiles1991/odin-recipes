            <li>Make the cups. Cut the bacon in half. Take a half of a slice of bacon and wrap the bacon around the smoke sausages. Then, secure them with a toothpick or place them in a muffin tin. </li>
            <li>Make the cream cheese mixture. Mix the cream cheese, sour cream, diced jalapeno, sharp cheddar, and seasonings together in a medium bowl. </li>
            <li>Add the mixture to the sausage cups. Add the cream cheese mixture to a piping bag or a quart-size baggie and clip the bottom corner. Then, squeeze the cream cheese filling into each cup. </li>
            <li>Bake. Top each shot with a sliced jalapeno and then brush each one with the honey BBQ mixture. Bake at 375 degrees for 40 to 45 minutes or until the bacon is crispy.</li>
            <li>Enjoy. Carefully remove the shots from the muffin tin and enjoy! </li>
