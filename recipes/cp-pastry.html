            <li>Large egg</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Coarse sugar</li>
            <li>Bing cherries</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Cornstarch</li>
            <li>Lemon juice</li>
            <li>Cream cheese</li>
            <li>Egg yolk</li>
            <li>Vanilla extract</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Powdered sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>MAKE THE CHERRY FILLING. Add cherries, sugar, and lemon juice to a medium saucepan over low heat and stir. Then, mix the water and cornstarch together and mix it into the cherry mixture. Cook, stirring constantly for 3 to 4 minutes until the sauce thickens. Remove it from the heat and let it cool.</li>
            <li>MAKE THE CREAM CHEESE FILLING. Beat the cream cheese for 2 to 3 minutes in a medium bowl until fluffy. Then, add teh sugar, egg yolk. lemon juice, and vanilla extract and beat again until combined.</li>
            <li>FILL THE PUFF PASTRY. Gently open up the puffy pastry and roll a few times on a lightly floured surface until square and an even thickness. Spoon half the cream cheese mixture down the center of each pastry sheet, leaving about 1 Â½ inches of space at each end. Then, top the cream cheese mixture with the cherry mixture.</li>
            <li>BRAID. Cut two 1-inch long slits at each end of the puff pastry (see photo) and fold them over the top of the filling to keep it from leaking out. Then, cut the top and bottom side pieces at an angle (see photo) and continue making cuts down each side, making sure not too cut too close to the filling. Fold each piece over the filling in a braid.</li>
            <li>BAKE. Mix the egg and water and brush the egg wash over both pastries. Then, bake for 25 to 30 minutes until golden brown. Remove the pastries from the oven and let them cool a bit</li>
            <li>GLAZE. Mix the powdered sugar and milk together and drizzle over the warm pastries. Enjoy!</li>
